> Implement a design from scratch

## Description
In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

> This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer. 

## Project Notes
* We are using a UI pack called Sharps for the layout of the web app.
